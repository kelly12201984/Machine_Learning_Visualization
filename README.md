# Sports Analytics: Performance Prediction Modeling: Visualization & ML

This repository focuses on Formula 1 racing predictions:

## 📊 F1 Data Visualization Poster
- Created a visual data story exploring trends in driver and constructor performance.
- Used R and ggplot2 to visualize points, wins, and consistency across the 2023–2024 seasons.
- Poster aimed at F1 fantasy players and data enthusiasts.

## 🤖 F1 Constructor Performance Analysis (Applied Machine Learning)
- Analyzed constructor standings from 1964 to 2024 using cleaned F1 historical data.
- Identified top predictors of constructor success using decision trees and feature engineering.
- Applied log and inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformations to normalize skewed variables.
- Narrowed focus to 2014–2022 races for consistency in rules and point structure.
- Created performance distribution plots and ranked key KPIs using model feature importance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **R**: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, randomForest, rpart, corrplot
- **R Markdown** for code and report formatting
- **PowerPoint** and **PDF** report for stakeholder-ready presentation

## 📁 Files Included
- `F1_DataAnalysis.Rmd`: Annotated analysis notebook
- `F1Racing_ConstructorAnalysis.Arseneau.docx`: Final project report
- `K_Arsenea_proj.pptm`: Presentation slide deck

## ✅ Outcomes
- Built visuals and models that highlight how strategy, qualifying, pit stops, and consistency impact team success.
- Produced insights that could help guide predictions and understand performance trends in F1.
